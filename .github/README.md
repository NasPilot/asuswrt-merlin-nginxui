## Configuration Files

### `.github/markdown-link-check.json`
Configuration for markdown link checking:
- Ignores local and private network URLs
- Custom headers for GitHub API
- Retry configuration for reliability

## Usage Examples

### Manual Release
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Build and Release
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
4. Choose draft/prerelease options
5. Run workflow

### Dependency Updates
- Runs automatically every Monday
- Creates PR with updated dependencies
- Includes test results and security audit

### Performance Monitoring
- Automatically runs on every PR
- Comments bundle size analysis
- Alerts on performance regressions

## Secrets Required

The following secrets should be configured in repository settings:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For code coverage reporting (optional)

## Permissions

Workflows require the following permissions:
- `contents: read/write` - For repository access
- `packages: write` - For Docker image publishing
- `security-events: write` - For security scanning
- `actions: read` - For workflow access

## Monitoring

### Build Status
All workflows provide status badges that can be added to README:

![Docker](https://github.com/NasPilot/asuswrt-merlin-nginxui/workflows/Build%20and%20Push%20Docker%20Image/badge.svg)
```

### Notifications
- Failed workflows notify repository maintainers
- Security vulnerabilities create issues automatically
- Performance regressions comment on PRs

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Review dependency update PRs weekly
2. Monitor security scan results
3. Update workflow versions quarterly
4. Review performance metrics monthly

### Troubleshooting
- Check workflow logs for detailed error information
- Verify required secrets are configured
- Ensure branch protection rules don't conflict
- Review permissions for workflow failures

## Contributing

When modifying workflows:
1. Test changes in a fork first
2. Update this documentation
3. Follow security best practices
4. Use semantic versioning for workflow updates
